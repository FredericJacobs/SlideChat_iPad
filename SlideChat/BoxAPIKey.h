/*
 The BoxRESTApiFactory creates NSString versions of urls given input parameters for many of box's API calls.
 
    see the SideBar on http://developers.box.net/
 
 The API calls require an API_KEY - see below to replace it. You can get this API key from http://developers.box.net/
 
 Many of these API calls also require a token. This token string uniquely identifies a user and an application and never expires. 
 This way you only need to have a user login once.
 
 Please enter your API Key below.
